# RESKA Token Upgrade Path

This document outlines the upgrade strategy for the RESKA token contracts, providing transparency and clarity on how future modifications will be handled securely.

## Current Architecture

The RESKA token is currently implemented as a non-upgradeable contract with the following security features:

- Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions
- Pausable functionality for emergency situations
- ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks
- Strict minting caps to control token supply

## Future Upgrade Mechanisms

### Phase 1: Proxy Implementation (If Required)

If future functionality requires an upgrade mechanism, we will implement the following:

1. **Transparent Proxy Pattern**

   - Deploy the RESKA token logic as an implementation contract
   - Deploy a TransparentUpgradeableProxy with the implementation address
   - Deploy a ProxyAdmin owned by a Timelock Controller

2. **Governance Timelock**

   - Implement a 48-hour timelock for all upgrades
   - Require a 3-of-5 multisig to propose and execute upgrades

3. **Implementation Verification**
   - All new implementations must be formally verified and audited
   - Source code must be published and verified on blockchain explorers
   - A detailed changelog and upgrade motivation must be published before proposing

### Phase 2: DAO Governance (Long-term)

For long-term governance, we plan to transition to a fully decentralized approach:

1. **Governor Contract**

   - Deploy a Governor contract based on OpenZeppelin's Governor implementation
   - Parameters: 3-day voting period, 5% quorum, 50% vote differential threshold

2. **Proposal Requirements**

   - Minimum token holding threshold (1% of circulating supply) to create proposals
   - 2-day review period before voting starts
   - Community discussion forum for all proposals

3. **Emergency Procedures**
   - Maintain a security council multisig for emergency pauses
   - 3-of-7 signature threshold with mandatory rotation every 6 months
   - Documented incident response procedure with public post-mortems

## Upgrade Validation Checklist

Before any upgrade is approved, the following checks must be completed:

- [ ] Full test suite passes with 100% coverage on new implementation
- [ ] Independent security audit completed by at least one reputable firm
- [ ] Storage layout compatibility verified (no variable reordering)
- [ ] Gas costs analyzed and optimized
- [ ] Public testing period on testnet for at least 2 weeks
- [ ] Complete documentation of changes and impact analysis
- [ ] Formal verification of critical security properties

## Monitoring and Incident Response

All upgrades will be monitored for:

- Gas usage patterns
- Error rates
- Compatibility with existing integrations
- Unexpected state changes

An incident response team will be on standby during and after each upgrade with the capability to:

1. Pause the contract if anomalies are detected
2. Roll back to previous implementation if necessary
3. Communicate transparently with the community about any issues
