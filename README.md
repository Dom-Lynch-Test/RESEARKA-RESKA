RESEARKA (RESKA) Academic Utility Token
# Researka RESKA Academic Utility Token

Researka’s RESKA token is a native ERC‑20 utility token designed to power a decentralized academic publishing ecosystem. Built for the zkSync Era Layer‑2 network, RESKA enables transparent, low‑cost incentives for authors, reviewers, and curators across all research disciplines. By aligning token‑based rewards with platform activity, Researka democratizes access to scholarly publishing and drives community‑governed growth.

At its core, the RESKA token serves three main purposes:

1. **Submission & Review Incentives**  
   • Authors receive RESKA when they submit manuscripts.  
   • Reviewers earn RESKA for each peer review they complete.  

2. **Royalty & Staking Rewards**  
   • A percentage of article download fees flows back to authors as royalties.  
   • Token holders can stake RESKA to secure the network and earn additional yield.

3. **DAO Governance**  
   • RESKA holders propose and vote on platform upgrades, fee structures, and treasury allocations.  
   • A modified quadratic voting mechanism ensures fair, community‑driven decision making.
