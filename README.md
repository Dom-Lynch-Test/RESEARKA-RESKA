# Researka Utility Token (RSKA)

RESEARKA (RSKA) is the native utility token of **Researka**, a decentralized academic publishing platform built on zkSync. It aligns incentives across the entire research lifecycle—rewarding authors for submissions, reviewers for peer review, and the community for curation—while ensuring transparency, low fees, and rapid settlement on a Layer‑2 chain.

By staking RSKA, community members earn yield and help secure governance votes on platform upgrades. Authors spend RSKA to submit manuscripts and unlock premium editorial tooling, then receive a generous 65% royalty on each paid download. Reviewers are paid in RSKA for each thorough evaluation, fostering rigorous, double‑blind peer review without the bottlenecks of traditional journals.

The total supply is capped at **100 million RSKA** to create scarcity and long‑term alignment. Below is the full allocation:

| Allocation Category                  | Percentage | Tokens      |
|--------------------------------------|-----------:|------------:|
| Founder                              |       10 % | 10,000,000  |
| Advisors                             |        5 % |  5,000,000  |

| Public Sale / DEX Liquidity          |       10 % | 10,000,000  |
| Long‑Term Escrow (3 years)           |       10 % | 10,000,000  |
| **Total**                            |     **100 %** | **100,000,000** |

Whether you’re a researcher seeking fair compensation, a reviewer craving timely reward, or a backer eyeing long‑term appreciation, **RSKA** powers a more open, equitable scholarly communications network—where knowledge truly moves at the speed of research.
